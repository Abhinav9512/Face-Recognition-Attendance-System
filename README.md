# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
1. Built Face Recognition Attendance System using Open CV and Python.
2. System takes student image via webcam and matches it with the available student dataset. Records the student attendance in case there is a match else alarms for an unknown person.
3. Finally by using Open CV tools I were able to record the attendance of students.
